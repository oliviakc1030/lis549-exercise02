    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Venice, Italian Venezia, city, major seaport, and capital of both the provincia (province) of Venezia and the regione (region) of Veneto, northern Italy. An island city, it was once the centre of a maritime republic.</p> 
     <p>It was the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and the continent’s commercial and cultural link to Asia. Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically, and in its days as a republic the city was styled la serenissima (“the most serene” or “sublime”). It remains a major Italian port in the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world’s oldest tourist and cultural centres.</p>

    <h3>Getting There From the Airport</h3>
    <p>You can get from Venice Airport to Venice by city bus, express shuttle, water bus, or taxi. You can also rent a car without a driver. The trip by bus will take about 30 minutes, the bus fare is EUR 8. The shuttle will reach the destination in 20 minutes, and you will have to pay EUR 7 for such a trip.</p>

<h3>Getting There From Rome</h3>
    <p>Traveling from Rome to Venice by bus is the most budget-friendly option, with prices starting at $16 when booked in advance. Tickets get more expensive as the travel date gets closer—up to $70 for a one-way ticket—which cancels out the price benefits of using the bus. Direct routes from Rome take between six and eight hours and depart from Tiburtina station, with arrival options of Tronchetto or Mestre. Mestre station is outside of Venice and requires further transportation to enter the city. Tronchetto is the bus station and car park that is on the water, and a three-minute tram ride will take you from Tronchetto to the central Piazzale Roma.</p>
